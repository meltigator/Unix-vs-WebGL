## WebGL in 1 Minute? Yes, Thanks to Unix & MSYS2!


Just built a zero-config WebGL demo entirely with Bash + Unix tools on Windows (via MSYS2)! 


# Why it’s cool:

1. No heavy frameworks – Three.js loaded directly from CDN 

2. Automated setup – Bash script generates HTML, JS, and assets in seconds 

3. 100% portable – Runs with a simple python -m http.server 

4. Customizable – Now featuring a rotating cube with multi-colored faces! 


# Want to see the magic? Here’s how to run it:

bash
bash webgl_demo.sh  
Then open http://localhost:8000

Key takeaway: Unix & Bash aren’t just for scripting—they can create sleek, modern demos with minimal effort. Whether for quick prototypes, portfolio pieces, or interview challenges, this method keeps things simple and effective.

Big thanks to MSYS2 for bringing Unix power to Windows devs!
